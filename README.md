### a game I made I guess

---

*"whew, that took longer than expected."*

here's an old game I started aaages ago! it took a hell of a lot of refactoring to get this stable enough to actually build, and there's still a lot of stuff missing that really shouldn't be...but I'm done! included in this repo is both the full, up-to-date source code and as many release builds I could find, even dating back to when this project was titled UltraCubed! (kinda glad I didn't stick with that name, given it's a 2D game...)

feel free to play it or mod the code how you like- I don't see myself doing much more with this dinky little project so go nuts!

who knows, I may even work on another java project in the future- I'm personally a lot more excited to move on to proper game engines and lower-level languages, though :)
